Basic Disk Partition Offsets: wmic.exe

Windows can be interrogated for disk-related information via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). A straightforward method for obtaining partition starting offsets of Windows basic disks is this Wmic.exe command.

wmic partition get BlockSize, StartingOffset, Name, Index



To verify that an existing partition is aligned, divide the size of the stripe unit by the starting offset of the RAID disk group. Use the following syntax:
((Partition offset) * (Disk sector size)) / (Stripe unit size)
Note Disk sector size and stripe unit size must be in bytes or in kilobytes (KB).

Example of alignment calculations in bytes for a 256-KB stripe unit size:
(63 * 512) / 262144 = 0.123046875
(64 * 512) / 262144 = 0.125
(128 * 512) / 262144 = 0.25
(256 * 512) / 262144 = 0.5
(512 * 512) / 262144 = 1
Example of alignment calculations in kilobytes for a 256-KB stripe unit size:
(63 * .5) / 256 = 0.123046875
(64 * .5) / 256 = 0.125
(128 * .5) / 256 = 0.25
(256 * .5) / 256 = 0.5
(512 * .5) / 256 = 1
These examples shows that the partition is not aligned correctly for a 256-KB stripe unit size until the partition is created by using an offset of 512 sectors (512 bytes per sector).

Note The number of disks in the array group does not affect the partition alignment. The factors that affect partition alignment are stripe unit size and partition starting offset.

To find the starting offset for a given partition, follow these steps:

   1. Click Start, click Run, type cmd, and then click OK.
   2. Type the following command, and then press Enter:
      wmic partition get BlockSize, StartingOffset, Name, Index
      Note After you run the command, you receive output that resembles the following:

      BlockSize  Index  Name                     StartingOffset
      512          0    Disk #1, Partition #0    32256
      512          0    Disk #2, Partition #0    32256
      512          0    Disk #3, Partition #0    32256 
      512          0    Disk #4, Partition #0    1048576 
      512          0    Disk #0, Partition #0    32256 
      512          1    Disk #0, Partition #1    41126400

   3. Notice the value of BlockSize and of StartingOffset for each given partition. The Index value that is returned by this command indicates whether a partition is the first partition, the second partition, or other partitions for a given disk drive. For example, a partition index of 0 is the first partition on a given disk.
   4. To determine how many disk sectors a given partition starts from the beginning of the disk, divide the value for StartingOffset by the value of BlockSize. In the example in step 2, the following calculation yields the partition starting offset in sectors:

      32256 / 512 = 63
